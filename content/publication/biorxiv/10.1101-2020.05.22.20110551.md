abstract = "Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies have been described, but correlation with virologic outcomes is limited. Here, we find anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG to be associated with reduced viral load. High viral loads were rare in individuals who had seroconverted. Higher viral load on admission was associated with increased 30-day mortality (OR 4.20 [95% CI: 1.62-10.86])."
