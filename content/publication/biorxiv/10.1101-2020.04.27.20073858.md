abstract = "We investigated the SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody titers in 133 asymptomatic healthcare providers working at the Department of Laboratory Medicine of our tertiary center. A commercial chemiluminescence immunoassay, validated according to the ISO15189 standard requirements, was used. All the enrolled healthcare professionals underwent, simultaneously to the blood sampling, a nasopharyngeal swab for molecular testing with quantitative reverse-transcriptase-based polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). An overall positiveness of 5.25% was found. We strongly promote a wide use of validated serologic assays in asymptomatic, healthy individuals, as a crucial information for epidemiological surveillance."
