abstract = "So far, 170,000 Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have been confirmed in Germany, of which more than 5,000 have been detected in the Frankfurt am Main metropolitan region. When examining 1,000 nasopharyngeal swabs and serum samples from healthy volunteers from this region, one RT-PCR-positive and five antibody-positive persons were identified. The five positive serum samples were confirmed to be specific. Four of the five positive sera cross-neutralized SARS-CoV."
