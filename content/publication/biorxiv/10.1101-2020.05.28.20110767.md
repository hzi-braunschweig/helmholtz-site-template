abstract = "The prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers with intensive exposure to COVID-19 is unclear. In this study, we investigated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in 797 asymptomatic healthcare workers with intensive exposure to COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, China. Positive IgG was detected from 35 asymptomatic healthcare workers, and the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in asymptomatic healthcare workers was 4.39% (35/797). None of them developed COVID-19 until May 15. 33 of them have performed at least one chest CT scan showing no viral pneumonia features, and 16 have finished at least one-time SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection with negative results. When contacting with the patients, 15 of them dressed with full personal protective equipment (PPE), and 16 worn N95 mask and gown. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation reported that the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was 4.39% in asymptomatic healthcare workers with applied PPE in a high epidemic area, which may provide useful information of estimating asymptomatic infection rate in general population."
