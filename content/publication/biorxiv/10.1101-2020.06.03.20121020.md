abstract = "The serosurvey is an alternative way to know the magnitude of the population infected by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) since the expansion of capacity of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was delayed. We herein report seroprevalence of COVID-19 accessed in the two community clinics in Tokyo. The point-of-care immunodiagnostic test was implemented to detect the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody in the peripheral capillary blood. The overall positive percentage of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody is 3.83% (95% confidence interval: 2.76-5.16) for the entire cohort (n =1,071). The central Tokyo of 23 special wards exhibited a significantly higher prevalence compared to the other area of Tokyo (p =0.02, 4.68% [95%CI: 3.08-6.79] versus 1.83 [0.68-3.95] in central and suburban Tokyo, respectively). The seroprevalence of the cohort surveyed in this study is low for herd immunity, which suggests the need for robust disease control and prevention. A community-based approach, rather than state or prefectural levels, is of importance to figure out profiles of the SARS-COV-2 outbreak."
